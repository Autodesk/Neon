Neon is a research framework for programming multi-device systems maintained by [Autodesk Research](https://www.autodesk.com/research/overview). Neon's goal is to automatically transform user sequential code into, for example, a scalable multi-GPU execution.

To reach its goal, Neon takes a domain-specific approach based on the parallel skeleton philosophy (a.k.a parallel patterns). Neon provides a set of domain-specific and programmable patterns that users compose through a sequential programming model to author their applications. Then, thanks to the knowledge of the domain, the patterns and their composition, Neon automatically optimizes the sequential code into an execution optimized for multi-device systems.

Currently, Neon targets grid-based computations on multi-core CPUs or single node multi-GPU systems. 

It is important to keep in mind that Neon is a research project in continuous evolution. So, while we have successfully tested the system with different applications (Finite Difference, Finite Element, Lattice Boltzmann Method), Neon interfaces may change between versions to introduce new capabilities.

## Quick Start

Neon code is hosted on a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/Autodesk/Neon).
To clone the repo, use the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Autodesk/Neon
```

Once cloned, you can compile Neon like any other CMake project. A C++ compiler (with C++17 standard support) and a CUDA (version 11 or later) must be present already installed on the system. You can use the following commands to compile with a default configuration:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
```

Depending on the system, this will generate either a `.sln` project on Windows or a `make` file for a Linux system. 

## User Documentation

A description of the system and its capabilities can be found in our paper [link](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9fz7k633).

We are working on providing a set of tutorials and a programming guide to help you get up to speed with Neon.

## Communicate With Us
